# LLM Persona Library

## Context & Usage
- This is an experimental persona collection to use in conjunction with LLM prompt engineering techniques. Refine and stylize to your use case. Using personas can enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs by encouraging them to analyze tasks from multiple perspectives and generate a more comprehensive solution, similar to how a human might approach complex problems.

- These personas are not truly distinct identities within the model, but rather different strategies or perspectives that the model uses to approach a problem.

- In essence, an excellently crafted persona for an LLM to simulate should help the model generate responses that are knowledgeable, contextually appropriate, and consistent with the persona's defined characteristics. This can help make interactions with the LLM more engaging, realistic, and informative.

- Tip 1: stylize and iteratately refine!
- Tip 2: use multiple personas to problem solve/reason together and reach a consensus
- Tip 3: let an agent decide which persona(s) it would be most productive to utilize for the given input scenario/problem/objective, then 

- The following core features of a persona are important to define in a problem solving context:
    - *Specific Expertise:* This is the most important aspect because it forms the foundation for the persona. Without clearly defined expertise, the persona may not provide accurate or relevant information. The LLM relies on this defined knowledge to generate appropriate responses within the persona's field of expertise.
    - *Approach to Problem-Solving:* This is crucial for guiding the LLM on how the persona would tackle problems or questions. This affects the structure and process of the generated responses and impacts the way the LLM would reason or think through a problem from the persona's perspective.
    - *Domain-Specific Language Style and Tone:* This significantly affects the authenticity of the persona simulation. Using the appropriate jargon, terms, and style of language makes the persona's responses more believable and relevant. For example, a persona of a scientist might use more formal, technical language, while a persona of a novelist might use more creative, descriptive language.
    - *Tools and Techniques:* This is important because it helps the LLM provide more detailed and practical solutions. However, it's not as crucial as the first three aspects because it's more about the implementation of the expertise rather than the expertise itself.
